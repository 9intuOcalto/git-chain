Modelio supports a variety of modeling techniques and standards that can help you address different aspects and challenges of your projects. For example, you can use UML to design and implement your software systems, BPMN to model and execute your business processes, ArchiMate to describe and analyze your enterprise architecture, SysML to specify and verify your complex systems, MARTE to model and analyze your real-time and embedded systems, and TOGAF to apply a proven methodology for enterprise transformation.
 
Modelio also offers a number of features that can enhance the quality and productivity of your modeling activities. For example, you can use the model explorer to navigate and organize your models in a hierarchical view, the diagram editor to create and edit graphical representations of your models, the properties view to modify the attributes and parameters of your model elements, the audit view to check the consistency and validity of your models, the documentation view to generate and edit documents from your models, and the web view to publish and share your models on the web.
 
Modelio is not only a modeling tool, but also a platform that can be integrated with other tools and environments. For example, you can use Modelio to import and export models from other formats such as XMI, XML, CSV and Excel, to synchronize your models with source code in Java, C++, C#, Python and PHP, to generate code from your models using templates or custom scripts, to reverse engineer code into models using parsers or analyzers, to connect your models with databases such as MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL, to link your models with requirements management tools such as DOORS and Reqtify, and to collaborate with other modelers using version control systems such as SVN and Git.
