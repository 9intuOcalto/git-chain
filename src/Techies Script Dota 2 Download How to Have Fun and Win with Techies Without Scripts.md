# How to Use Techies Scripts in Dota 2
 
Techies is one of the most controversial and hated heroes in Dota 2, mainly because of his ability to plant mines that can instantly kill unsuspecting enemies. Some players use scripts or macros to automate some of his actions, such as detonating mines, dropping items, or taking runes. These scripts are considered cheating and can get you banned from the game. However, some players still use them and claim that they make Techies more fun and effective. In this article, we will explain what Techies scripts are, how they work, and where to download them.
 
## What are Techies Scripts?
 
Techies scripts are programs or codes that run in the background while you play Dota 2. They can perform certain actions for you without your input, such as:

- Auto-detonate mines when an enemy is in range.
- Detonate the exact amount of mines needed to kill an enemy.
- Drop items before using Soul Ring or Arcane Boots to maximize mana efficiency.
- Take runes automatically when they spawn.
- Zoom out the camera to see more of the map.

These scripts can give you an unfair advantage over your opponents, as they can react faster and more accurately than a human player. They can also make Techies more enjoyable to play, as you don't have to worry about micromanaging your mines or items. However, they also come with some risks and drawbacks, such as:

- They are against the rules of Dota 2 and can get you reported and banned.
- They can be detected by Valve's anti-cheat system or by other players who watch your replays.
- They can make you dependent on them and reduce your skill level.
- They can malfunction or crash and cause you to lose the game.

## How do Techies Scripts Work?
 
Techies scripts work by using a third-party software that interacts with Dota 2. There are different types of software that can run scripts, such as:

- BotMek: A program that allows you to create and use macros and scripts for various games, including Dota 2. It has a database of ready-made scripts that you can download and install in two clicks. You can also customize your own scripts using a simple interface. BotMek is free to use, but it has some limitations and ads. You can find more information and download BotMek from [here](https://botmek.com/share/?group=Dota%202).
- Ensage: A framework that provides various features and tools for Dota 2, such as scripts, hacks, mods, overlays, etc. It has a large community of developers and users who create and share scripts for different heroes and situations. Ensage is not free to use, but it has more options and support than BotMek. You can find more information and download Ensage from [here](https://ensage.io/).
- Github: A platform that hosts code repositories for various projects, including Dota 2 scripts. You can find and download scripts from Github by searching for keywords like "techies script dota 2". However, you need to have some knowledge of coding and programming to use these scripts. You also need to be careful about the source and quality of the scripts, as some of them may be outdated, buggy, or malicious. You can find an example of a Techies script on Github [here](https://github.com/aznelite89/TechiesDemolitions).
