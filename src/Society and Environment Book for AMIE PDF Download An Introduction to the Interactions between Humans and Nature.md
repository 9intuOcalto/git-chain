One of the recommended books for this subject is *Society and Environment: An Introduction* by Egbert Tellegen and Maarten Wolsink. This book provides a comprehensive and interdisciplinary overview of the concepts, theories and methods of environmental sociology. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities for environmental policy and action in different social contexts.
 
However, finding a hard copy of this book might be difficult or expensive, especially if you live in a remote area or have a tight budget. Fortunately, there is a way to download this book in PDF format for free from the internet. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Go to the website of ResearchGate, which is a platform for researchers to share their publications and collaborate with others. You can access it from this link: [https://www.researchgate.net/](https://www.researchgate.net/)

3. Click on the title of the result to open the page of the publication. You should see a preview of the book and some information about it, such as the edition, publisher, ISBN, etc.
4. On the right side of the page, you should see a button that says "Download full-text PDF". Click on it to start downloading the book to your device.
5. Once the download is complete, you can open the PDF file with any compatible reader software and enjoy reading it.

Note that this method might not work for all books or publications, as some authors or publishers might restrict access to their works or require payment or registration. However, ResearchGate is a reputable and legal source of academic literature that often offers free access to many publications.
