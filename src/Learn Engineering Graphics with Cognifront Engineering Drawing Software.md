Engineering drawing or technical drawing or engineering graphics is the language of communication between various engineering departments. It demands spatial rotation and folding abilities to visualize and represent three-dimensional (3D) objects in two-dimensional (2D) views. However, many students and teachers face difficulties in understanding and explaining the concepts and techniques of engineering drawing.

Cognifront Engineering Drawing is a software product that aims to solve this problem by providing interactive tools to explain glass box theory, various views of objects and techniques of projection. The software uses 3D figures extensively to ensure that the true essence of the subject is covered. It also offers unique teaching-learning process driven tools like intersection of objects, development of surfaces, isometric projection, orthographic projection, perspective projection and more.
 
Cognifront Engineering Drawing is designed to inspire your classroom, whether you teach online classes or offline on-campus classes. You can capture the attention of your students by showing them excellent visuals that clarify their doubts. You can also save your 30% time and efforts by using these tools in your Google Meet, Zoom Classes, WebEx presentations or Microsoft Team online classrooms.
 
Cognifront Engineering Drawing is used by more than 100 institutions in India and abroad, including IIT Madras, IIT Guwahati, Don Bosco University, University of Oslo in Norway, IIT Bombay, IIT Patna, University of Nairobi in Kenya, NIT Surat and many more. The software has received positive feedback from users who have appreciated its quality, usefulness and ease of use.

In this article, we will give you a brief overview of some of the features and modules of Cognifront Engineering Drawing software. You can also watch a video demonstration of the software [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhISBNMRqZg).
 
## Glass Box Theory
 
The glass box theory is a fundamental concept in engineering drawing that helps to understand how to obtain different views of an object. The software explains this theory with 3D animations and interactive exercises. You can rotate, zoom and pan the 3D object inside the glass box and see how its projections change on the six faces of the box. You can also select different types of objects such as prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, spheres and solids of revolution and see their projections.
 
## Intersection of Objects
 
The intersection of objects is a technique that helps to find the common portion or line of intersection between two or more objects. The software provides a tool that allows you to select two objects from a list of predefined shapes and see their intersection in 3D and 2D views. You can also change the position and orientation of the objects and see how the intersection changes accordingly. The software also explains the steps involved in finding the intersection analytically.
 
## Development of Surfaces
 
The development of surfaces is a technique that helps to find the unfolded or flattened shape of a 3D object. The software provides a tool that allows you to select an object from a list of predefined shapes and see its development in 2D view. You can also change the size and shape of the object and see how its development changes accordingly. The software also explains the steps involved in finding the development analytically.
