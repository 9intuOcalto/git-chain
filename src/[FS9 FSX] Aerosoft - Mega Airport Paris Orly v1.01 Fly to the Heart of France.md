## The History of Paris Orly Airport
 
Paris Orly Airport has a long and rich history that dates back to the early 20th century. It was originally a military airfield that was used by the French Air Force during World War I and World War II. It was also the site of several historic flights, such as the first transatlantic flight by Charles Lindbergh in 1927 and the first supersonic flight by Concorde in 1973.
 
After World War II, Orly became the main airport of Paris, serving both domestic and international flights. It was expanded and modernized several times to accommodate the growing demand for air travel. In 1974, however, the opening of Charles de Gaulle Airport shifted most of the international traffic to the new airport, leaving Orly mainly for domestic and European flights.
 
Today, Orly is still a busy and important airport, handling over 30 million passengers per year. It has two terminals, four runways, and over 200 gates. It is also a hub for several airlines, such as Air France, Transavia, and Aigle Azur. It offers flights to over 100 destinations in Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America.
 
## The Layout of Mega Airport Paris Orly
 
Mega Airport Paris Orly by Aerosoft replicates the layout and design of the real airport with great accuracy and detail. It covers an area of about 15 square kilometers and includes all the buildings and facilities of the airport. It also features realistic ground markings, lighting, and signage that match the current state of the airport.
 
The add-on has two options for installing the scenery: a high resolution option and a standard resolution option. The high resolution option uses textures with a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, while the standard resolution option uses textures with a resolution of 512x512 pixels. The high resolution option provides better visual quality, but it may also affect your frame rates and performance. You can choose which option to use depending on your system specifications and preferences.
 
The add-on also allows you to customize some aspects of the scenery, such as the amount of static aircraft, dynamic vehicles, and animated objects. You can adjust these settings using a configuration tool that is included with the add-on. You can also enable or disable some features, such as seasonal textures, night lighting, and AESLite support.
